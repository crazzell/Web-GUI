<h5><span id="What_s_the_audio_hardware.3F">What's the audio hardware?</span></h5> 
<p>There are going to be (at least) 3 versions of the audio carrier card that brings out audio 
specific functionality: SWAMP0.5, CSP1 and CSP2</p> 
 
<h5><span id="What_s_SWAMP0.5.3F">What's SWAMP0.5?</span></h5> 
<p>SWAMP0.5 is the first prototype board to test the concept. It is not available to buy. It 
measures 4.3&quot; x 3.6&quot; and is populated with a DAC chip, TOSLINK, 2 USB jacks (one for host 
only and one for OTG), ethernet, and a serial port.

</p> 
 
<h5><span id="What_s_CSP1.3F">What's CSP1?</span></h5> 
<p>CSP1 will be a beta version of the hardware carrier card. The user will be required to provide 
a Wandboard module, unscrew 4 screws and install it on the carrier board.</p>
<p>The specification (subject to change) for CSP1 is:</p> 
<ul>
<li>6.3&quot; x 6.3&quot;</li> 
<li>Hammond 1455T1601 case</li> 
<li>Extruded aluminium with PCB slots designed for 6.3&quot; boards</li> 
<li>Separate screwed on end plates</li> 
<li>Connectors on one side of the board (the back) and stick through holes on the custom 
end plate.</li> 
<li>The front end plate has nothing on it, so it can be whatever you want, use the one that 
comes with the case or be creative.</li> 
</ul>
<p /> 
<p>Connections (starting from the right side, working left are):</p>
<ul> 
<li>top: barrel power jack, bottom: micro USB as power connector</li> 
<li>top: RJ‐45 Ethernet jack, no bottom</li> 
<li>top: micro OTG USB jack, bottom: HDMI jack</li> 
<li>top: stacked USB full size type A jacks (host jacks, type on laptops etc), no bottom</li> 
<li>top: BNC jack (SPDIF), bottom: TOSLINK</li> 
<li>top: 3.5mm headphone jack, no bottom</li> 
<li>top: 2 RCA jacks side by side, bottom: 2 XLR jacks side by side</li> 
</ul>
<p />
 
<h5><span id="Can_you_re-order_the_jacks.3F">Can you re-order the jacks?</span></h5> 
<p>John can't really re‐arrange the order of the jacks; it's determined by the pin order on that 
giant connector. If he changed the order he would have high speed differential signals 
crossing each other, and he doesn't want to do that.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="Is_there_going_to_be_a_status_LED.3F">Is there going to be a status LED?</span></h5> 
<p>There will be nothing on the front panel, just a green power LED on the back (directly across 
the incoming power feed)</p> 

<h5><span id="Will_there_be_balanced_outputs_on_CSP1.3F">Will there be balanced outputs on CSP1?</span></h5>
<p>Yes, but the balanced outputs will take some software work to get running. Most likely this 
will not be ready when the CSP1 board is first released, so don't expect to hook up the 
balanced outputs at first. (Well you can hook them up, you will just get silence!)</p> 
 
<h5><span id="Is_there_anything_on_the_front_panel_in_CSP1.3F">Is there anything on the front panel 
  in CSP1?</span></h5> 
<p>No, there is nothing on the front panel.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="Are_there_any_hooks_for_experimenters.3F">Are there any hooks for experimenters?</span></h5> 
<p>Most likely there will be some headers on the board with an SPI and I2C and a couple of GPIO's 
for people who really want to experiment, but these will not be guaranteed to be exactly the 
same on subsequent boards. They will not have external connectors. Use at your own risk.</p>
 
<h5><span id="Will_there_be_a_user_interface_on_CSP1.3F">Will there be a user interface on CSP1?</span></h5> 
<p>Whilst there isn't a built in display, Jivelite can be used to control the player using an 
external TV or monitor via the HDMI port.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="How_can_you_control_CSP1.3F">How can you control CSP1?</span></h5> 
<p>The traditional SB control options will all work (server web UI, external programs on smart 
phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, the Duet controller, a SB Touch, etc.) There will also be some 
form of HDMI output and IR input which can be used for control. There will be a built‐in web 
server for configuration purposes.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="How_many_CSP1_s_will_be_made.3F">How many CSP1's will be made?</span></h5> 
<p>An estimated 25 units will be fabricated.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="What_s_after_CSP1.3F">What's after CSP1?</span></h5> 
<p>CSP2 will be the general release version. It is expected that there will be at least 2 distributors, 
one in Europe and the other in the USA. 
It is hoped (but to be confirmed) that there will be the option of purchasing the bare DAC carrier board, 
or a ready to go, pre‐built player, assembled, tested and comprising the DAC carrier board, 
Wandboard Dual CPU board, Hammond extruded aluminium chassis, front/rear panels, (glass fibre PCB 
material), a power supply, and a pre‐imaged SD card.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="Is_CSP1_CSP2_going_to_include_IR_receivers_blasters.3F">Is CSP1/CSP2 going to include 
  IR receivers/blasters?</span></h5> 
<p>No, IR devices will be supported by third-party modules. eg. 
<s:a href="http://flirc.tv" target="blank_">FLIRC</s:a>.
</p> 

<h5><span id="Is_it_possible_to_have_audio_on_SPDIF_and_analog_at_the_same_time.3F">Is it possible 
  to have audio on SPDIF and analog at the same time?</span></h5> 
<p>All outputs can physically be on at the same time, whether they can in actuality is a matter 
of software. Currently Squeezelite doesn't support more than one output, but it can 
certainly be done using the ALSA duplication technique used in the Touch.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="Will_CSP1_come_with_trigger_outputs.3F">Will CSP1 come with trigger outputs?</span></h5> 
<p>The CSP1 board will not have dedicated control outputs. They can easily be added using USB. 
By using USB you can get exactly what you want with drivers that already exist. There are 
literally hundreds of USB to control boxes out there at very inexpensive price points that can 
cover just about anything anybody may want.</p>
 
<h5><span id="What_about_CSP2.3F">What about CSP2?</span></h5> 
<p>The complement of IO's on CSP2 has not been decided. John's personal preference is to not 
put dedicated connectors on the player for things that can easily be done with USB. This will 
keep down the connector count on the back panel</p> 
 
<h5><span id="What_is_the_PSU_for_CSP1.3F">What is the PSU for CSP1?</span></h5> 
<p>The power supply used for a Wandboard will be usable for CSP1. The Carrier card will also 
include a micro USB port as an (optional) power port. You can use either the barrel connector 
or the USB port for power (just not both at the same time). The barrel connector is 5.5mm x 2.1mm. 
Both 5.5mm x 2.1mm and 5.5mm x 2.5mm connectors can be used.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="If_you_get_a_Wandboard_now__can_you_re-use_its_CPU_card_for_later_releases.3F">If you 
  get a Wandboard now, can you re-use its CPU card for later releases?</span></h5> 
<p>Maybe, but at the present time we don't know yet whether we will be releasing the later products 
without CPU modules.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="How_can_I_be_a_beta_tester_for_CSP1.3F">How can I be a beta tester for CSP1?</span></h5> 
<p>There is no official beta group yet, no official &quot;list&quot;. When CSP1 is getting closer 
to being available we will do that. So don't start trying to jockey for position in the list just yet, 
any such requests are going to be ignored at this point.</p>  
 
<h5><span id="Will_the_CSOS_be_embedded_on_the_board_in_Gen2.3F">Will the CSOS be embedded on the board 
  in Gen2?</span></h5> 
<p>No, it will still require that a OS software image is installed on a SD card.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="Will_Wi-Fi_be_supported.3F">Will Wi-Fi be supported?</span></h5> 
<p>Yes, it will. The Wandboard Dual CPU module contains built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth via a 
Broadcom chipset.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="How_well_will_this_player_synchronise_with_existing_Squeezeboxes.3F">How well will this 
  player synchronise with existing Squeezeboxes?</span></h5> 
<p>Well, hopefully. It is Squeezelite based on a Linux OS and the discussions on the Squeezelite 
thread regarding sync on the Linux forum are relevant. It is not as good as a Squeezebox 
Touch at present, but there's scope for tuning the OS further to improve this. Fundamentally 
it's doing very similar things to the Touch, and with tuning of the software we hope this can 
be improved.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="How_easy_is_it_to_setup.3F">How easy is it to setup?</span></h5> 
<p>It's pretty easy. It will use the existing LMS server software and should behave like most 
Squeezeboxes. To configure wireless settings, such as entering a Wi-Fi password, you'll plug it 
into your wired network. It will use DHCP to configure itself on the network, and then it will 
have a built‐in web interface for configuring Wi-Fi.</p> 
 
<h5><span id="How_will_you_control_it_if_it_doesn_t_have_a_display.3F">How will you control it if it 
  doesn't have a display?</span></h5> 
<p>It won't have a built‐in display, so you'll need some other way to control the player across 
the network. That could be a smartphone or tablet, but it doesn't have to be. It could be 
controlled through the web interface of LMS, or you could use your Touch (you can point the 
Touch's user interface at any Squeezebox player on your network).</p> 
 
<h5><span id="Do_you_need_to_be_familiar_with_Linux_to_get_this_all_to_work.3F">Do you need to be 
  familiar with Linux to get this all to work?</span></h5> 
<p>No, you just need to load the CSOS image to an SD card.</p>

<h5><span id="Why_use_a_BNC_connector_for_co-axial_SPDIF_output.3F">Why use a BNC connector for 
  co-axial SPDIF output?</span></h5>
<p>The SPDIF spec says the connections should be 75R, yet RCA connectors are in the 25R
range, a huge mismatch. BNC connectors come in 75R which is correct for the spec. RCA to
BNC adapters and cables are readily available so there is a 75R connector on the board so
those that want to keep a true 75R match can do so. Unfortunately, BNC connectors also 
come in both 50R and 75R, so when buying a cable make sure it is using 75R BNC connectors. 
</p>
<p>
<s:a href="http://www.bluejeanscable.com/store/digital-audio/index.htm" target="blank_">
Blue Jeans Cable</s:a> sells reasonably priced 75R Belden digital audio cables, (by the foot), 
which can be ordered with various connectors fitted, including &quot;true&quot; 75R BNC 
connectors. (Note: Whilst we have read several positive owner reports, we do not have first hand 
experience with this supplier or their cables.)
</p>

<h5><span id="How_do_you_use_a_SPDIF_cable_terminated_with_RCA_connectors_with_the_BNC_connector.3F">
  How do you use a SPDIF cable terminated with RCA connectors with the BNC connector?</span></h5>
<p>You can buy BNC to RCA adapters.
</p>
<p>
As far as the impedance specification of these adapters is concerned, they will most likely be  
50R BNC to RCA, but since the impedance of the RCA connector on your cable is likely to be 
much lower than 50R in any case.... The point being, that if you wish to follow the specification, 
you need to use a good quality 75R cable, fitted with 75R BNC male connectors, with 75R BNC female 
connectors being used on the receving/transmitting equipment.
</p>
<h5><span id="How_do_you_update_CSOS_on_the_Wandboard_when_new_software_is_released.3F">How do you 
  update CSOS on the Wandboard when new software is released?</span></h5>
<p>New or updated software releases are announced in the CSOS thread. At the present time, 
to apply these updates, you must do so from a shell command prompt after having logged into the Wandboard. 
The actual command for updating the software is included at the end of the software announcement post. 
To login to the Wandboard, use PuTTY or another SSH Client. Access is via the IP Address of the 
device, (which can be found by accessing your router and looking for attached devices), using user=fedora
password=fedora. When you have the a shell prompt displayed, type the update command posted in the 
CSOS thread. Be careful to type the command correctly. Correct case, (upper/lower), and spaces are 
important on a Linux system! 
</p>

<h5><span id="Does_the_Wandboard_have_enough_performance_to_reliably_run_LMS.3F">Does the 
  Wandboard have enough performance to reliably run LMS?</span></h5>
<p>Yes, it does. 
</p>
<p>To run LMS on the Wandboard, you will need to mount your music from either a USB drive, CIFS 
(Windows share) or NFS share. The Squeeze Server (LMS) system service needs to be enabled and 
started, using the Web-UI. (Once the service has been enabled, it will be
